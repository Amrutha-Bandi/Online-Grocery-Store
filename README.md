5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct an initial exploration of the data to understand its structure and main characteristics:

Descriptive statistics: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation.
Visualization: Histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to visualize distributions and relationships.
